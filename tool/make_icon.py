# An Android adaptive icon only guarantees the centre 2/3 of its foreground
# survives the launcher's mask, so the face has to fit inside that. iOS shows
# the whole square. The same crop framed for one is visibly wrong on the other,
# which is why these are two files rather than one.
#
# The art is a crop that bleeds off its own bottom edge. Centring it inside the
# safe zone puts that cut edge in the middle of the frame with empty space
# under it, which reads as a sticker someone tore in half. Bottom-aligning to
# the canvas instead sends the cut off the edge, where the mask hides it, and
# the icon reads as a face rising into the frame — which is the whole point of
# cropping it in the first place.
ADAPTIVE_SAFE = 2 / 3

# ...and then a little past it. The 2/3 guarantee is the floor Android
# promises, not what a launcher actually shows — a launcher masks the WHOLE
# 108dp layer, so an icon framed to the guarantee floats small in a sea of its
# own background. This oversizes by 21%, which puts the top of the art just
# outside the guaranteed box.
#
# Worth stating, because it is easy to get backwards and it is what makes the
# art run off the bottom edge instead of stopping short of it: the 72dp safe
# zone is where content is *guaranteed* to survive, not the region that is
# displayed. Render a candidate against a mask inscribed in the full 108dp,
# not in the safe box — masking the safe box instead makes every icon in this
# family, Penny's and Wick's included, look decapitated, and invites a "fix"
# that leaves a transparent gap under the mascot.

    faint a pixel is: the ghost drags the computed centre sideways and inflates
